### Preface
This guide will allow you to replicate the network of VMs that I configured for this project. A basic knowledge of Bash, PowerShell, and VirtualBox is assumed.

The deployment scripts assume a host system with specifications similar to the following:
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800x
* GPU: AMD RX 6600 XT
* RAM: 32GB DDR4
* Storage: 1TB (SSD strongly recommended) 

### Host Setup 
* Install Oracle VirtualBox 

* Run the script **VM.ps1** if you are on a Windows host or **VM.sh** if you are on a Linux host, this will create and configure the seven virtual machines.

* Download the following OS images:
    * [Fedora Server 40](https://fedoraproject.org/server/download)
    * [Fedora Workstation 40](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download)
    * [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server)
    * [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11)
